In sixth grade, we had an assignment to write something that might have been a short story, might have been a medium length story, or might have been the start of the novel. I honestly don't remember, but I do remember that I resolved to expand mine into a full novel. I had never really had a long attention span for my projects, so this was a huge change of pace.

I finished majority of the novel through middle school, but eventually forgot about it until later in high school when I felt I should probably revisit and finish this novel. Early in my senior year, I finally self-published a somewhat edited version of my book: Journey to Imalum.

The final product was not amazing, and had a wide assortment of writing styles stretching from 6th grade me to 11th grade me, but I was proud that I finished all ~78000 words of it. Thankfully, Amazon self-publishing doesn't have any screening process, so for a period of time, my book was available to purchase there. I'm not sure when it was taken down, but it is no longer available to purchase at this time. If you are curious, here's a [read-only Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UeVr-HzuX8bm56iwCeA0nBZVCwZDK33lfM_Sfvb5tnw/edit?usp=sharing).
