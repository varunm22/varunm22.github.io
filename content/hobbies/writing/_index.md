What I was a child (and now), I loved to talk and tell stories. As a way to redirect my energy, my parents and teachers encouraged me to write these stories down. When I was in kindergarten, I wrote my first stories, some of which I've found more recently, and they were indecipherable. One, however, was my magnum opus: The Caterpillar, the full text (and pictures) of which are preserved in a post below.

In sixth grade, I decided I wanted to write a whole novel. It took me several years, and the end result wasn't particularly good, but I *did* finish it.

More recently, I've tried writing a couple short stories which I'm slightly happier with. All linked below!
