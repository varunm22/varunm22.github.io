This next sculpture was one I made while visiting Neha. She was less excited about [geometric figures]({{< ref "/hobbies/snow/post-2-cube" >}}), so we decided to make a rose! It was much warmer here than it had been in MN, so we didn't need to start by piling up the snow and waiting for it to compress. We were able to just create our pile and immediately start carving out the base to make the basic shape of the rose. We weren't able to finish on the first day, and unfortunately when we resumed a couple days later, the snow had melted and refrozen enough to become icy and brittle. As a result, we had to be far more cautious when we carved out the petals, and in certain places, the pedal edges collapsed anyways. However, I think the effect still ended up working pretty well!
