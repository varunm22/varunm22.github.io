In March 2020, I came home to Minnesota at the start of Covid lockdowns. In early April, we had a typical large MN snowfall, and for the first time, I found myself with both the free time of youth as well as the engineering knowledge I had gained. It was time to make things out of snow. I only had the one big batch of snow to work with that winter, but I resumed my work the following year.
