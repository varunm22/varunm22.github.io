As mentioned in my [dino paintings blog post]({{< ref "/hobbies/painting/post-1-dinos" >}}), I find dinosaurs to be a reasonable default subject for new artistic pursuits. With new snow on the ground, I wasted no time on deliberation and got started on my dinosaur! 

The weather was fairly warm, so the snow was easy to stick to itself. I was pretty concerned about the structural integrity of the neck and head, but the snow held fine! I was also able to dig out the space underneath the bellow so that the legs were each separate from each other.
