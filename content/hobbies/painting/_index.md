Painting is something I've enjoyed here and there for quite a while. My first fond memory of doing so was in 8th grade art class when our assignment was to paint a sports scene for a sport we played in a pop art style. Taking pride in my lack of athleticism, I chose a picture of a guy getting hit in the face with a baseball. To my surprise, my art teacher actually liked my painting and selected it to put on the wall near the student lockers. To my greater surprise, it remained there years later when I visited again during high school. To my even greater surprise, it's still available on the [school's art portfolio website](https://www.artsonia.com/museum/art.asp?id=13942099)!

Since then, I've painted a few things on my own and most recently, I've had a bunch of paint nights with friends to build up a paint wall in my apartment. All detailed in posts below!
