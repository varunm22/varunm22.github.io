Painting is something I've enjoyed here and there for quite a while. My first fond memory of doing so was in 8th grade art class when our assignment was to paint a sports scene for a sport we played in a pop art style. Taking pride in my lack of athleticism, I chose a picture of a guy getting hit in the face with a baseball. To my surprise, my art teacher actually liked my painting and selected it to put on the wall near the student lockers. To my greater surprise, it remained there years later when I visited again during high school. To my even greater surprise, it's still available on the [school's art portfolio website](https://www.artsonia.com/museum/art.asp?id=13942099)!

My next phase of painting was during my college freshman summer when I was doing my first internship. I bought paints to have something to do after work, as this was the first time in my life I didn't have homework. This summer, I painted several simple dinosaur paintings, detailed in [a separate post]({{< ref "/hobbies/painting/post-1-dinos" >}}).

The next blip was at the start of my college junior summer, when I painted what is still probably my single favorite thing I've painted. I was staying with my aunt for a couple days before starting my internship, and I took the opportunity to paint with my artist cousin Sonika didi. We both did Chuck Close inspired pieces, mine depicting a dinosaur, and her's a cat. More details [in the post]({{< ref "/hobbies/painting/post-2-big-dino" >}}) again.

The most recent stretch of painting has been more of a social than solitary activity. In January 2022, one of my cousins gave me some extra paints her kids weren't using, which ended up spawning 15+ paint nights over the course of over a year. Things slowed down a bit in 2023, but even so, these paintings formed a giant mosiac paint wall in the living room of my apartment. Once again, [more details here]({{< ref "/hobbies/painting/post-3-paint-wall" >}}).
