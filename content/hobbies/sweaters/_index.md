In January 2019, I went to Norway for an internship and wanted to buy a chunky wool sweater while there because it seemed like the right sort of thing to bring back. I purchased an on-sale past season color Dale of Norway sweater in the Arctic city of Troms√∏, and thus began my love affair with wool sweaters.
