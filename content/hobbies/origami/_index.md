title: "Origami"

This is a hobby I've been intereted in over two separate phases. I was first interested in early high school, during which I made a variety of simple models from Youtube videos, and more interestingly, experimented with folding a tiny crane using toothpicks instead of my fingers.

I revisited this hobby during the covid lockdown, and ended up being sucked into it from around January 2021 to February 2022. During this time, I made [an instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/varun_origami/) to document my folds. This was a great way to engage more with other folders and keep track of everything I'd made!

I also experimented a bit with origami design, which involves a surprising amount of geometry. I read through [Robert Lang's book on the subject](https://langorigami.com/publication/origami-design-secrets-2nd-edition/) and created three very simple box pleated designs (using [Box Pleating Studio](https://bpstudio.abstreamace.com/)). Details on each present in posts below.
