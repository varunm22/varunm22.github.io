The baby sea turtle was my second origami design. If you want to fold this, the crease pattern is below.

In this case, instead of starting with circle packing, I started by making the pleats I eventually wanted to end up on the back of the shell, then just played around until I felt the head and legs looked about right. For help folding, I made [an album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/9A7B7yotWEp5mnS86) with pictures at various stages.

Like with the lizard, multiple people folded the design after I posted it!
