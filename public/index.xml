      <description>My second origami design - the simple sauropod (pics at more angles on the insta):
If you want to fold this, the crease pattern is below.
Here, like with the lizard, I started with a tree diagram and did circle packing through box pleating. In this case, I found I wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite able to pack box pleating squares sufficiently, so I used a technique called the Pythagorean stretch which is what creates the strange polygonal areas in the pattern.</description>

In this case, instead of starting with circle packing, I started by making the pleats I eventually wanted to end up on the back of the shell, then just played around until I felt the head and legs looked about right. For help folding, I made an album with pictures at various stages.</description>

Most origami design starts with creating a tree structure representing the rough shape of your final figure. Then, you covert terminal nodes in the tree into circles to pack into the square, with each circle corresponding to a spike as long as the circle&amp;rsquo;s radius in the final design. In this case, the final model looks basically the same as the tree diagram, so we can jump right to the circle packing:</description>
