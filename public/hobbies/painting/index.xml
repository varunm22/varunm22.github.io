      <description>In January 2022, one of my cousins gave me some extra paints her kids weren&amp;rsquo;t using, which ended up spawning 15+ paint nights over the course of over a year. Things slowed down a bit in 2023, but even so, these paintings formed a giant mosiac paint wall in the living room of my apartment.
Overall, I&amp;rsquo;m up to 57 total paintings (2 not pictured as they&amp;rsquo;re on the second wall) from 20+ people.</description>

      <description>At the start of my college junior summer, I painted what is still probably my single favorite thing I&amp;rsquo;ve painted. I was staying with my aunt for a couple days before starting my internship, and I took the opportunity to paint with my artist cousin Sonika didi. She&amp;rsquo;s absolutely fantastic and paints pieces for galleries while also working in art education. See her pieces here!
We looked at a variety of modern artists to get style inspiration, and ended up settling on Chuck Close.</description>

      <title>Painting: a series of dinosaurs</title>

      <description>During my college freshman summer when I was doing my first internship. I bought paints to have something to do after work, as this was the first time in my life I didn&amp;rsquo;t have homework. This summer, I painted several simple dinosaur paintings!
So why dinosaurs? As a kid, I was obsessed with dinosaurs, and this aspect is something most people still associate with me. I didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily feel like I HAD to only paint dinosaurs, but they felt like a reasonable default subject to use to practice different styles.</description>
